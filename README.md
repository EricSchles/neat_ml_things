Hello new coworker!

Here is a list of tools I'd recommend using for analysis:

Blog posts:

This post on
[interpreting models that are complex](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ideas-on-interpreting-machine-learning) shows some some interesting techniques that might be worth pursuing.

[This post](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-logistic-regression-in-python-step-by-step-becd4d56c9c8) shows some good insights on how to use feature engineering.

[This post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)) shows an interesting technique for clustering algorithm interpretation.

[This post](https://towardsdatascience.com/train-test-split-and-cross-validation-in-python-80b61beca4b6) some great examples of how to do K-Fold in your code.  So you can learn on all of your training data, which you'll need to since there is so little "Y" data (the sentiment indexes).


Packages:
